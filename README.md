It’s a perfect example of how machine learning and data science can tackle big challenges in the real world.

Main Objectives
The project had two main goals:
1.	To cluster postal codes based on their daily electricity consumption patterns and find common behaviors.
2.	To forecast short-term energy use to improve planning and decision-making.

Key Contributions
Here’s what I worked on:
1.	Clustering Analysis
o	I grouped postal codes based on how they use electricity using KMeans Clustering.
o	I used Silhouette Scores to find the best number of clusters and PCA to make the data easier to visualize.
o	Result: We uncovered clear patterns in electricity usage that decision-makers could act on.
2.	Adding Context
o	I combined weather data, socio-economic information, and past energy use to give more meaning to the clusters.
o	I engineered features like temperature, population size, and yesterday’s energy use to make the patterns more useful.
o	Result: The richer data helped create insights that were easier to understand and apply.
3.	Classification Model
o	I trained a Random Forest Classifier to assign new data points to clusters in real-time.
o	I evaluated it carefully using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-scores.
o	Result: This model made it possible to track how consumption patterns changed over time.
4.	Energy Forecasting
o	I built an LSTM neural network to predict energy use for the next 96 hours.
o	I used features like historical sequences and added dropout layers to avoid overfitting.
o	Result: The forecasts were accurate and helped planners make better, location-specific decisions.
